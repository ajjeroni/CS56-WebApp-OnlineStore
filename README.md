## Challenges We Faced
* The first challenge we faced was learning about servlets and how to use them. We learned that we needed to download Apache Tomcat to contain the servlets. We also needed to use Maven to manage dependencies and simplify the build process for our project.
* The second challenge was learning how to connect the front-end and the back-end. We had the front-end completed. And the backend that included a data model with several logical classes that uses inheritance. We learned about JSP, a HTML-like file that allows developers to create dynamic web content by combining HTML and Java, which made the connecting process simpler by using Interpolation to send Java variables to the front-end.
* The third challenge was communication between our group. Since we are college students, our priorities and availability are always changing, this makes it difficult to work on the project synchronously. This made the project advance at a slower rate and made room for bugs since we were not all on the same page with the code. Thankfully, the project is functional but not the best version of itself.

## Not Working Features
The feature that we did not implement was the Slots interface, this is because we did not have enough time and we also did not have the front-end code working for the slot feature.

Another feature that is not working is the delete option for the users cart. There is no way to delete products from the cart at this moment, so if the user has an item that they no longer want, they would have to restart the application. We understood that making a delete feature would require us to change the servlets and front-end structure, which due to time constraints was not the best option. 

Under other circumstances, if we had more time, we would restructure and redesign the file, front-end, and servlet structure. Knowing what we know now, we believe we understand OOP programming better because of our experience in trying to make a real-life project.
